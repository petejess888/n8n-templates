The Enhanced Email AI Auto-Responder addresses these challenges by combining n8n's workflow automation capabilities with modern AI language models and vector database technology. The system automatically:

1. Receives and processes incoming emails through IMAP
2. Summarizes and classifies email content
3. Retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base
4. Generates contextually appropriate responses based on email category
5. Ensures quality through AI-powered review
6. Delivers responses with appropriate formatting and business context
7. Captures analytics for continuous improvement
8. Handles errors with appropriate notifications

### 1.3 Technical Prerequisites

To implement this workflow, you'll need:

- n8n instance (version 0.214.0 or later)
- Email account with IMAP and SMTP access
- Access to AI services (OpenAI API or alternatives)
- Qdrant vector database (self-hosted or cloud)
- Google Drive account (for document storage)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript for customization

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Workflow Structure

The workflow is organized into three primary phases:

1. **Setup Phase**: Prepares the vector database and imports knowledge documents
